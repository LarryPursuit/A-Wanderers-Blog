            JavaScript is a popular programming language used primarily for web
            development. It can be used to create dynamic and interactive web
            pages, as well as to add functionality to web applications.
            JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, meaning that it runs
            on the client's web browser rather than on the server. This allows
            for faster response times and a more interactive user experience.
            JavaScript code is typically embedded in HTML code using script
            tags, which allow the browser to execute the JavaScript code.
            JavaScript provides a number of built-in objects and functions that
            can be used to manipulate web page elements, interact with the user,
            and perform calculations and other operations. Some of the key
            concepts in JavaScript include variables, data types, functions,
            conditional statements, loops, and objects. Variables are used to
            store data values, and data types include strings, numbers,
            booleans, arrays, and objects. Variables are used to store data
            values, and data types include strings, numbers, booleans, arrays,
            and objects. Objects are collections of properties and methods that
            can be used to represent complex data structures or to encapsulate
            functionality. JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used
            for a wide range of applications, from simple scripts to complex web
            applications. Learning JavaScript is a great way to enhance your web
            development skills and create more dynamic and interactive web
            pages.
